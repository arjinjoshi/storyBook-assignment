            Once upon a very glitchy compile-time in a foggy corner of the internet called EternalPending-PR-land, there lived a developer named Rajiv Thapa. Everyone just called him Raj because typing his full name felt like committing too many characters to a single line of code. Raj was not your ordinary software engineer. He was the chaotic neutral type who named his home Wi-Fi network “PrettyFlyForAWiFi_5G”, gave his Docker containers the names of girls who ghosted him on dating apps, and wrote git commit messages that read like diary entries from a man slowly losing his grip on reality.
His greatest hits included classics such as “Fix literally everything because yesterday me is an idiot”, followed twenty minutes later by “Revert ‘Revert “Fix stupid bug”’ because apparently I’m even stupider”, and the evergreen crowd-pleaser “pls just work I’m begging” typed at 3:47 a.m. with tears in his eyes and instant coffee stains on his hoodie. Raj worked for a startup in Lazimpat that had somehow convinced venture capitalists to throw several crore rupees at an app called MomoMate. The app promised to be “Your AI Momo Wingman” and would forever change the sacred art of deciding whether today’s momo craving deserved chili chicken, buff, or the forbidden veg option that nobody ever admitted to wanting.
The original pitch deck was legendary. It featured cartoon momos wearing tiny sunglasses giving double thumbs-up while floating in a sea of animated jhol. Somehow nobody in the boardroom had asked why an artificial intelligence needed shades to recommend steamed dumplings. The trouble all began on an otherwise unremarkable Tuesday morning in January. The clock on Raj’s battered MacBook Pro read exactly 10:47. He was floating in that rare meditative state achieved only by consuming his third cup of the day’s instant coffee, a brew that tasted like regret mixed with burnt electrical tape.
That was when Slack lit up with the message that would haunt him for weeks. Anjali, the product manager who communicated exclusively in bullet points and passive-aggressive emojis, wrote, “Raj can you quickly look at why the ‘Spicy Level’ slider is going backwards on iOS 17.4.1 on iPhone 13 mini when the user has dark mode plus Nepali language plus low power mode plus airplane mode on?” Raj stared at those words the way a deer stares at oncoming headlights on the Prithvi Highway. He already knew that “quickly” was about to become the funniest joke of his week.
He responded with the only sane reply a developer can give under such circumstances: “repro steps?” Anjali fired back seventeen screenshots, three screen recordings, a forty-seven-second voice note that was mostly just heavy breathing and the occasional muttered curse in Newari, and the single most cursed sentence Raj had ever read in a professional context: “It only happens when the user’s name contains exactly three ‘ा’ matras and their momo preference is set to ‘extra jhol’.” At that moment Raj felt the familiar icy trickle of sweat travel down his spine. It was the universal signal that he was about to cross the event horizon into debugging hell.
He ran git pull origin main and immediately received four hundred and nine merge conflicts. Apparently the entire team had decided to touch the same files at the same time over the weekend. Forty-seven minutes of manual conflict resolution later, during which he accidentally deleted the entire authentication module and had to resurrect it from the reflog like some kind of digital necromancer, he finally had a build that didn’t explode on launch.
He fired up the iOS simulator, tapped the spicy level slider, and watched it behave like a perfectly well-adjusted UI component. He switched the language to Nepali and the slider remained cheerful. He enabled dark mode and the slider gave a little wink as if to say “I got you bro.” Low power mode? Still perfect. Airplane mode? That was when the slider slowly rotated one hundred and eighty degrees, locked eyes with Raj through the glass of the simulator window, slid itself all the way to the left, and—somehow—played the Windows XP critical stop sound effect even though nobody had coded that in.
Raj whispered “Bro… why are you like this?” to an empty room before diving into Xcode’s view debugger. Seventeen layers deep inside a UIView mysteriously named MomoJholMeter he discovered a CALayer labeled _NSZombie_UILabel. It was an undead artifact left behind from some long-forgotten 2022 refactor that nobody had bothered to clean up. Raj did what any traumatized developer would do: he left a comment block that read “Dear future intern who finds this: I tried to kill it. It came back stronger. May God have mercy on your soul. — Raj, 19 Jan 2026, already on his fifth energy drink” before committing the file with the message “zombie apocalypse but it’s just one UILabel refusing to die.”
The rest of the day was a blur of meetings, including an all-hands “vibe check” during which the CEO announced they were pivoting to micro-frontends next quarter. This caused the only frontend engineer Saugat to begin quietly weeping in the corner of his Zoom tile while someone else’s background showed an AI-generated buffalo wearing AirPods. When it was Raj’s turn to demo the shiny new “MomoMood AI” feature the screen share accidentally revealed his desktop wallpaper: an extreme close-up of an enraged plate of momos overlaid with bold red text screaming “STOP CALLING ME CHICKEN.”
The demo itself ended in spectacular fashion when the mood analyzer spun for eleven seconds and then crashed with EXC_BAD_ACCESS at address 0xdeadbeef. It was a memory address so comically on-the-nose that the entire company stared in stunned silence for exactly three point seven seconds before the intern Prajwal whispered “Is… is that a feature?” Raj muted himself, walked to the kitchen, opened the fridge, stared into the cold judgmental eyes of yesterday’s leftover dal bhat, closed the fridge, returned to his desk, and unmuted just long enough to croak “Working on it” with the serenity of someone who has already accepted their own demise.
That night he stayed until 2:13 a.m. tracing a retain cycle so vicious it deserved its own true-crime podcast. The leak lived in MomoSentimentAnalyzer and involved a URLSession task capturing self strongly inside a closure that was captured by a DispatchQueue that was captured by a notification observer that was captured by the tattered remnants of Raj’s dignity. He tried the classic weak self dance but the cycle laughed at him. He added a deinit print statement that read “MomoSentimentAnalyzer has died. Praise the lord.” Nothing printed; the object had achieved true immortality.
At 3:47 a.m. he finally uncovered the true villain hiding in a file cheerfully named AnalyticsManager+Swizzled.m where some ancient soul had decided method swizzling was still acceptable in the year 2026 because “legacy reasons.” They had swizzled dealloc on every NSObject subclass to fire an analytics event, which meant MomoSentimentAnalyzer could never die because its dealloc now contained a strong reference back to itself through a block inside the swizzled implementation written in cursed Objective-C.
Raj stared at the code the way one stares at a venomous snake that has just bitten you twice. He wrote a comment that began “If you are reading this after I have left the company: I want you to know that I tried. I really tried. Tell my mother I loved her. And tell the person who wrote this swizzle that I will find them in every lifetime” before performing the most cursed runtime surgery he knew, using class_addMethod, imp_implementationWithBlock, and a whispered prayer in Newari. Miraculously the object finally deallocated. The slider stopped doing interpretive dance. The mood analyzer stopped crashing. The zombie UILabel gave up the ghost.
Raj pushed the fix at 4:22 a.m. with the commit message “killed a thing that refused to die. you’re welcome humanity” before collapsing face-first onto the sofa still wearing his company hoodie. He dreamed that every momo in Thamel had grown legs and was chasing him through narrow alleys screaming “WHERE IS MY JHOL RATING???” in perfect unison.
The next morning he woke to forty-seven unread Slack messages. The first was from Anjali reading “Raj the slider is fixed!!! Amazing work!!! But now when users long-press the momo image it zooms in and then the app speaks ‘Jhol chahincha?’ in Deepak’s voice (the intern who left last month).” Raj closed Slack, opened his banking app, stared at a balance that mocked him silently, googled “how much do yak herders earn in Langtang,” closed the tab, opened a private browsing window, searched “how to disappear in Nepal without leaving digital footprint,” closed that tab too, and accepted the eternal truth.
He would fix this bug, and the next bug, and the bug after that, because the bugs do not choose you by accident; they choose you because you are the only one foolish enough to keep answering their call. Somewhere deep inside he knew the slider was never really broken. The broken part had always been him. And yet tomorrow—because there is always a tomorrow—he would open the laptop again, run git pull, stare at the blinking cursor, and whisper to the empty room “Alright you little gremlins… let’s dance.” Somewhere in the cloud a plate of momos wearing tiny sunglasses would give him a slow, knowing thumbs-up, because in the end that is all any developer ever really gets: a thumbs-up from a carbohydrate that refuses to stay in its lane.
