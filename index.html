          Today we learned about the github and git. Not only that, We had also
          explored a lot of git commands by ourselves. Among them the command
          which fascinated me alot was ` git commit --amend -m "message" `. This
          command is generally used to <em> rewrite the old comment(message).</em> That means it will delete the old message that we have passed with the commit and put the new written one while using this command.
          <br/> And if we haven't pushed the original commit yet, then we can use just <strong>`git push` command</strong>. But if we have <strong>already pushed</strong> the original commit to github then we must use <em>`git push --force` command</em>. Always make sure to use --force command on the branches instead of main.
