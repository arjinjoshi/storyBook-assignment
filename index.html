      <h1>Git Commands that we learned today</h1>

        <p>
          Today we learned about the github and git. Not only that, We had also
          explored a lot of git commands by ourselves. Among them the command
          which fascinated me alot was ` git commit --amend -m "message" `. This
          command is generally used to <em> rewrite the old comment(message).</em> That means it will delete the old message that we have passed with the commit and put the new written one while using this command.
          <br/> And if we haven't pushed the original commit yet, then we can use just <strong>`git push` command</strong>. But if we have <strong>already pushed</strong> the original commit to github then we must use <em>`git push --force` command</em>. Always make sure to use --force command on the branches instead of main.

        </p>
        <p>
        And if we want to use revert the commit message we can do it via <strong>`git revert HEAD -m "message"`</strong>. It will gonna work in both the cases: even if we have pushed the code on github or we haven't pushed yet. Also I learned, we can replace the HEAD with hashkey of most recent commit that we can see if we use <strong>"git log -1 --oneline"</strong>  and if we wanna see the full details we can use <strong>git log -5 --pretty=fuller</strong> then we can see the hashkey of each commit and if we want to revert multiple commits then make sure <strong>Revert the old one first</strong>

        <h4>This is my part of the Story </h4>
        <p>
          Dead Poets Society is about an inspiring English teacher, John Keating,
           who encourages his strict boarding school students to think for themselves, 
          embrace poetry, and “seize the day.” His unconventional teaching awakens their creativity and courage, 
          leading them to form a secret club where they read and perform poetry. 
          While they experience personal growth and challenge societal expectations, tragedy strikes, 
          leaving a powerful message about the importance of individuality and following one’s passion.

         <h4>This is Another Story.</h4>
         <p>
          In a mountain-ringed kingdom called Nepalaya, the rivers ran clear but the ledgers did not. Every year, 
          sacks of gold were carried up the stone steps to the Grand Hall, and every year the sacks came back lighter, 
          as if the air itself had learned to steal.
          The ministers spoke in velvet sentences. Roads were announced before they were drawn. 
          Schools were promised before they were planned. Bridges existed first as speeches, then as cracks.
          In the capital, banners fluttered like applause that never quite reached the ground.
          A young clerk named Aru worked in the records room, where dust kept secrets better than locks. 
          One night, while tallying figures that refused to agree, Aru noticed a pattern. The missing gold didn't vanish randomly. 
          It flowed like water into the same hidden channels. Names repeated. Dates aligned. The ledger whispered.
          Aru copied the pages and carried them through rain to a quiet newspaper office that smelled of ink and courage. 
          The story broke like a landslide. Some laughed it off. Some called it foreign wind. 
          But people began to ask why the road to their village ended in a promise.
          The kingdom didn't change overnight. It never does. Yet something shifted. The ledgers were unlocked.
          The rivers kept running. And in Nepalaya, children learned a new proverb: Mountains move slowly, but truth has gravity.
